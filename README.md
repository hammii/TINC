2. The first user takes a word card and chooses a word that matches his **"difficulty"**.<br>
3. The first user **"chooses pictures"** that are associated with words on the picture board.<br>
4. Through a combination of pictures, the oppnent **"guesses"** which words the first user has chosen (_within 5 minutes!_)<br>
5. If the answer is correct, the first user scores **"three points"**, while the opponent scores the **"dice"**.<br>
6. Repeat 2-5!!! The game is over when either of them **"reaches 20"**.<br><br>
